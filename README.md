This is a personal project named 'Wikipedia-Viewer' which is developed using Javascript(ES6), HTML and CSS, JSON, AJAX.
This is a complete responsive application viewed across all platforms such as tab/mobile. Used CSS3 module media queries for that.

Functionalities:
1.	User can search articles from Wikipedia using it's own API.
2.	After the search, it pulls articles related to the search query from the Wikipedia API, then displays 10 articles from it. There is a button in the
	bottom of the articles named 'Show more articles'. After the user clicks on it, it will display 10 more articles. This will happen till total 
	articles are 40.
3.	In the input field where user search for the articles, there is a random button, which displays a random article from Wikipedia on a seperate
	tab.
4.	In case user search with some garbage value then there will be a alert msg asking the user to search again with some other input value.
